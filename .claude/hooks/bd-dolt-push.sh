# PostToolUse hook: push to Dolt remote after bd write commands.
#
# Claude Code fires this hook after every Bash tool call. The hook:
#   1. Exits immediately for non-bd commands (no latency added).
#   2. Uses an inverted allowlist: read-only bd subcommands are listed; anything
#      else is treated as a write and triggers a push. This is more future-proof
#      than listing every write command.
#   3. Exits 0 if no dolt remote named "origin" is configured (local-only safe).
#   4. Dirty-checks before committing: if dolt auto-commit is on, bd already
#      committed and the tree is clean — skip add+commit to avoid empty-commit errors.
#   5. Runs `dolt push origin main` after bd write commands.
#   6. Always exits 0 — network failures must never block agent work.
#
# Note: dolt does NOT support a -C flag. All dolt commands use (cd dir && dolt …).
